 * mytheme_cart/viewcart.tpl -- nexus_cart SPA shell
 *
 * The Nexus cart Vue.js SPA (shipped with WHMCS, lives at
 * /templates/orderforms/nexus_cart/) is the modern replacement for
 * the standard_cart Smarty-rendered viewcart. Per the WHMCS9 docs
 * (section 18 / 27): "the layout of Nexus SPA pages cannot be
 * modified -- only CSS customization is allowed."
 *
 * So this TPL only does three things:
 *
 *   1. Mount points: <div data-app="cart-module" data-init="{getNexusData}">
 *      hands hydration JSON to the SPA. {getNexusData} is a WHMCS-
 *      provided Smarty function that serializes cart state.
 *
 *   2. Asset wiring: load nexus_cart's compiled bundle by absolute
 *      path so this works without changing mytheme_cart's parent
 *      inheritance (which would also pull in nexus's domainregister
 *      and could surprise other pages we've already themed).
 *
 *   3. Apple theming: override the SPA's --vl-* CSS variables to
 *      match the Apple visual language. The SPA uses Shadow DOM,
 *      so set the variables on BOTH :host and :root so they reach
 *      the shadow tree via custom-property inheritance.
 *
 * KEEP standard_cart/checkout.tpl include for the {if $checkout}
 * branch -- the SPA does NOT cover the post-cart checkout step on
 * this install (cart -> /cart.php?a=checkout still hits Smarty).
 *}

{if $checkout}

    {include file="orderforms/$carttpl/checkout.tpl"}

{else}

    {include file="orderforms/standard_cart/common.tpl"}

    {* The Apple --primary / --bg / --text variable overrides for the
       Vue SPA live in mytheme/templates/mytheme/assets/js/apple-theme.js
       (loaded globally by mytheme on every page including this one).
       We can't inject them from this TPL because WHMCS strips any
       <script src=>, <style>, <link>, style=, or inline <script> we
       add to cart TPL output when the page renders with the full
       mytheme layout shell. Putting the IIFE in the always-loaded
       global script reliably seeds the SPA's variable surface before
       main.min.js initializes its Shadow DOM. *}
